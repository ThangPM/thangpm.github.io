  - "I'm particularly interested in making AI systems more interpretable and efficient, recently developing SlimLM models for on-device document assistance and creating methods to enhance the explainability and robustness of language models in NLP and CV tasks. My current research focuses on developing efficient small language models and model optimization techniques for mobile devices, building robust retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and multi-agent architectures."
