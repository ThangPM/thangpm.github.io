I recently completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Auburn University advised by [Prof. Anh Nguyen](https://anhnguyen.me/), and **I am actively seeking full-time research/engineering positions in machine learning and artificial intelligence**. My doctoral work has contributed to advancing language models' capabilities in understanding texts and images, with findings that have been recognized by [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/12/1016031/jumbled-up-sentences-ai-doesnt-understand-language-nlp-bert-fix/) and published in top-tier conferences including ACL, NAACL, or EACL. My current research interests are efficient small language models, model optimization, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multi-agent systems.

During my Ph.D., I completed three research internships at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) working with [Trung Bui](https://research.adobe.com/person/trung-bui/), [Franck Dernoncourt](https://research.adobe.com/person/franck-dernoncourt/) and [David Seunghyun Yoon](https://research.adobe.com/person/david-seunghyun-yoon/), where I developed efficient small language models for mobile devices, instruction-following and human preference datasets for image editing, and creating a dataset benchmark for semantic similarity and search. Before my Ph.D., I spent 6 years in industry roles, including 2.5 years as a Research Engineer at [National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST)](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html) collaborating with [Makoto Miwa](https://www.toyota-ti.ac.jp/Lab/kde/members/makoto.miwa/) and [Mohammad Golam Sohrab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PgHT-KgAAAAJ) to build deep learning systems in biomedical text mining. I also worked as a Software Engineer for 3.5 years, developing [over-the-top mobile applications](https://beowulfchain.com/) for distant communication.
I completed my Honors Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the [University of Science (HCMUS)](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/) in Vietnam, where my thesis focused on scene text detection and recognition.

<!-- I'm particularly interested in making AI systems more interpretable and efficient, recently developing SlimLM models for on-device document assistance and creating methods to enhance the explainability and robustness of language models in NLP and CV tasks.  -->
